GCD Calculation using Euclid's Algorithm:
Start:

Input:

Initialize variables num1 and num2 with given values (e.g., num1 = 10, num2 = 5).
Euclid's Algorithm:

While num2 is not equal to 0:
Calculate remainder as the modulus of num1 divided by num2.
Set num1 to the current value of num2.
Set num2 to the value of remainder.
Continue until num2 becomes 0.
Calculate GCD:

After the loop, num1 will hold the GCD of the original num1 and num2.
Output:

Print the calculated GCD.
End.

Detailed Steps:
Initialization:

Initialize num1 to 10 and num2 to 5.
Declare variables gcd and remainder.
Euclid's Algorithm:

Enter a loop:
Calculate remainder as num1 % num2.
Update num1 to the current value of num2.
Update num2 to the value of remainder.
Repeat until num2 becomes 0.
GCD Calculation:

After the loop, num1 will hold the GCD of the original num1 and num2.
Assign the value of num1 to gcd.
Output:

Print the values of num1, num2, and gcd as the GCD of the given numbers.
Pseudocode:
plaintext
Copy code
procedure calculateGCD(num1, num2)
    while num2 != 0
        remainder = num1 % num2
        num1 = num2
        num2 = remainder
    end while
    gcd = num1
end procedure

main()
    num1 = 10
    num2 = 5
    calculateGCD(num1, num2)
    print "GCD of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + gcd
end main
This algorithm outlines the steps involved in calculating the GCD using Euclid's Algorithm, as implemented in the given program.
