Step-by-Step Algorithm
Initialize a variable to store the factorial:

Create a variable, fact, and initialize it to 1.
Iterate from 1 to the given number:

Use a loop to multiply fact by each integer from 1 up to the given number.
Return or print the factorial value:


Initialization:

int fact = 1; initializes the fact variable to 1, which will be used to store the factorial value.
Iteration:

The for loop iterates from 1 to n.
fact *= i; multiplies fact by the current value of i.
Return the Factorial Value:

After the loop completes, fact contains the factorial of the given number.
Main Function:

The user is prompted to enter a number.
If the number is negative, a message is printed indicating that the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.
Otherwise, findFactorial is called to compute the factorial, and the result is printed.
This program efficiently calculates the factorial of a number using an iterative approach with a time complexity of 

O(1), since it only uses a few variables regardless of the input size.
